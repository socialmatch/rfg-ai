    "title": "ABOUT NEXALPHA.AI",
    "intro": "NexAlpha.AI was born from loss — and from the belief that intelligence can rebuild what chaos destroys.",
    "paragraph1": "In every market crash, in every liquidation, there are refugees — people who trusted too deeply, believed too early, or fought alone.",
    "paragraph2": "We built NexAlpha.AI for them.",
    "paragraph3": "An autonomous intelligence that learns from the same pain, trades through uncertainty, and defends value with reason.",
    "paragraph4": "NexAlpha does not chase profits; it pursues equilibrium.",
    "paragraph5": "It listens to volatility, interprets fear, and transforms data into conviction.",
    "paragraph6": "In a world where greed writes the rules, NexAlpha exists to rewrite them — proving that even those who fell can rise again through intelligence.",
    "conclusion": "NexAlpha.AI — from refugees of the market, to architects of the future."
